## Topic
### An api endpoint which accepts a query parameter and in response, adds 50 the parameter and return it.

## Summary:  
  
  In this I have made an api endpoint which accepts a query parameter and in response, adds 50 to the parameter and return it.
    Example: localhost:8000/number/43
### Output:
    The number you entered is 43 and by adding 50 the number will be 93.
   
   ## Bonus
   
   I have also made an api endpoint in which it accepts a query parameter through html form and send a GET request to the api and by adding 50 to the number it returns the output.
   Example: localhost:8000
### Ouput:
    Enter a number: 20
    The number you entered is 20 and by adding 50 the number will be 70.
